"""
If we cannot find a trivial next tile, we will be using Probability Theory.

In the event that no trivial tile can be flagged or opened, we have two methods:
for nearby unknown tiles and for remaining not-nearby unknown tiles.

Nearby method is to go through every numbered tile, count number of unknown tiles
around it, and divide the number of the numbered tile by the number of unknown tiles.
This gives us the probability that the unknown tiles will be a bomb.

The found probability value is assigned to the unknown tiles nearby the
numbered tile. As individual unknown tiles get different probability values
from more than one numbered tile, an average (?perhaps a better way is available?)
is taken for that unknown tile. The tile with the least probability is chosen.

Not-nearby method is to assess the probability that any not-nearby unknown
tile has a bomb. This is done by calculating the minimum number of possible
bombs nearby (worst case scenario if choosing not-nearby unknown tile) and
substracting that from the number of remaining bombs. We divide our resulting
number by the quantity of not-nearby tiles. This gives us the probability that
one of the not-nearby tiles is a bomb.

We then compare the lowest probability nearby tile with the not-nearby tiles'
probability.
If individual tile, choose that.
If not-nearby or equal, choose random tile which is not near walls.

Old Text on Simulate method
-------------------------------

Simulate tile change on simulation_board(self,loc)

DISCUSSION
Make new simulation = Minesweeper(analysis=True) class?

However it might be overkill if we only want to check what would
happen next.

Perhaps it would be better if we just try as "assume [loc] is a bomb
tile. Check if remaining tiles would remain possible." (no more bombs
left but clearly there is a bomb next to a tile which would not remain)

Would it be better to write this within prob_nearby instead?
It is, after all, specifically for whether the tiles would contradict
if a tile were to happen to be a bomb. Proof by contradiction.

Nah, let's make it a seperate function which will be used at the end
of probability_nearby().

Try making prob board of simulation, if fail, prob becomes 0 or 1.

Current TODO:
    Copy current prob board and temporarily save it.
    For each unknown tile among nearby prob digits:
        Make change to prob board but do not alter real board or update from real board,
        ensure ai_next_move does not do it either.
        Iterate next moves until all nearby unknown tiles at start are filled.
        If no error is found:
            Check a different unknown_loc to simulate flag instead.
        If an error is found:
            Update original prob board to reflect the tiles flagged via
            proof of contradiction. 
            Break.
    If all moves are valid moves by the end, nothing is done.
    
THOUGHTS
The current problem is making the change without changing the real board
in ai_next_move().
Perhaps directly alter probability board? Yes, makes sense.
Then simulated board may not be needed.

However, this time we dabble too much with already existing functions,
which is causing problems. A recursive solution would have been more
elegant. Much easier to both provide depth and decide how deep.

TODO
Instead of a full seperate simulation board, how about just adding a new
type of acceptable symbol "wF" which stands for "what if F"? Would make much
more sense...
